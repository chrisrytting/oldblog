I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I belong to the [Perception, Cognition, and Control Laboratory](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/). In the past I have double-majored in [Mathematics (Applied and Computational Math Emphasis)](http://acme.byu.edu/) and [Economics](https://economics.byu.edu/), worked for the [Open Source Policy Center](www.ospc.org) out of [AEI](https://www.aei.org/), and interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
