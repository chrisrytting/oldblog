Truth should be the top priority. That's what I've always said. Knowing the way things are and how they work makes as easy as possible every objective that could be pursued. Morally, practically, subjectively, objectively, truth subsumes all.


This holds in the abstract and in the concrete. If you look at any particular advance, it is because truth was gotten closer to. From growing wheat to manufacturing cars, we know the truth and so leverage it to do a thing we want, whether it is to avoid starvation or avoid walking twenty miles to work.


So if you'd ask a genie for more of anything, it would be truth. Now, it's always sounded obvious when I've always said that; as to whether I've always meant it, well, I digress. There are some problems with truth as super-term-in-objective-function.


For example, if you hid in the bushes and watched me live life, I might sometimes decide not to acknowledge let alone absorb truths that are right there to be learned from. I might even forget ones that I've already digested. For example, it's been a long time since I've known to exist, but never watched, the surreptitious footage of concentrated animal feeding operations that might slap me vegan. And, actually, it's not even that I've just ignored the happenings of CAFOs. I've heard stories about baby calves being torn from their mothers, or pigs unable to turn around in their cages. Right away, my empathy and morality kick into high gear and drive me to the web, where I scout out local farms that would let me see how the cows are treated, whether their calves are torn away or happily under-udder, getting at least _some_ of the milk made for them. That could get me feeling pretty good about eating animal products. If I can scratch a little cow ear, I might even get feeling pretty great about it. But for every time that's happened, there's been a return afterward to straight up industrially-produced milk.


If I really loved truth, I would probably watch these videos that I know exist or remember the stories I've heard, so that when it comes to buying or not buying torture-made milk, I can just, well, not.


There are grayer areas than this, though. Imagine with me a scenario wherein one day I marry a real woman. After a couple of years she starts doing something that is neither pleasant nor in her control. Say she starts snoring really loudly every time she sleeps. Say also that the sleeping arrangement can't be changed, either by taking shifts or by splitting up or by noise-canceling headphones. In this scenario, I'm gonna lose sleep. Now, if she asks me after some months of this if there's anything I don't like about her, I'm gonna have to either say yes or lie to her face. _Why would you lie if truth trumps all_, you ask? Well, she has no control over this snoring, so what good does truth do here? I can either have her believe in our utterly happy marriage or I can confess to imagining quieter nights. Both will still include proverbial logs sawed, but the former will include less neurosis in wife than the latter (the former being the better outcome, to be clear).


It's sort of obvious that truth doesn't do much good in this example. Imagine a similar scenario, where truth might do even more damage: What if she came to believe something I found repugnant? Again, we'll constrain the situation to preclude any real change besides her coming to know how I feel; we can't split up over my repugnance, I can't dissuade her of this view, etc. Snoring is physiological and might be distanced from identity, but adopting an opinion involves agency, which is as close to her identity as it gets. If I disapprove of her choice, how can I not be disapproving of her? Again I ask, what good is airing a grievance if it will do nothing but remind her of my disapproval? The same situation but with more pain is worse.


The goodness of truth seems not to be self-contained, but contingent on its serving some effect or function. We've seen examples where truth  truth is obviously useful and ones where truth is obviously harmful, with shades of gray in between.


But maybe, if you love truth enough, you believe that these situations aren't ones where truth does harm, since real life isn't like our contrived examples with the only degree of freedom being whether my wife knows I don't like something about her. In real life, truth can lead both to more truth and to action. Her pointing out to me that a snore means she chose to sleep by my side each night could make me relish that snore instead of despise it. Or we could simply buy noise-cancelling headphones. Maybe it's not the truth that hurts, but a lack of response or culmination; partial truths hurt, but the whole truth will set us free.


So maybe in some learning-all-truth-in-the-asymptotic-limit way, my thesis about truth isn't wrong. But truth-seeking in real life is constrained by our mortality and finity. How many people out of 100 would or could do what my fictional wife had to do above for a complaint to actually make life better instead of worse? Detaching completely from feelings of defensiveness is exceptional if not impossible.


This brings us to the last scenario we'll consider, where we don't even need to do any imagining to see why more truth is not always best. This scenario is Twitter--and less so, the whole internet--where suddenly (relative to our evolutionary history) there is much more information available to us than we can process. Even if we took as granted that all tweets were "true", Twitter communicates as much and as widely as possible. Here, snapshots both short and disparate demand that we consider the most important, difficult, and complicated events that we can in as little time as our screens take to scroll.


Jevon's Paradox states that as an activity becomes more efficient, humans will do more of it, not less. Maybe Twitter felt like a good idea in part because with it you could read the gist of 25 articles in the same time it would take you to read an entire one. This cuts down your time reading by 25 times even while getting the high-level talking points of articles. The sociologist Zeynep Tufekci has studied how protests organized on social media are the biggest in history, but ultimately less effective than earlier protests. She supposes that modern protests require less persistent infrastructure than history's earlier protests. This results in more and bigger protests but less longevity to their movements.


By design, words like "reading" or "protest" or "truth" replace concepts that are much less concisely defined across whole sentences and paragraphs. In the computer age, we try to measure these things with bits instead of with neurons to include our machines in the conversation. At that point, we start optimizing for the words instead of what they stand for. Truth, much as tweets might point to it, cannot be communicated without our listening. I'm afraid that wanting it all will keep us from any of it.
